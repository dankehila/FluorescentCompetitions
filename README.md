Data and code for the paper

Measuring differential fitness costs and interactions between genetic cassettes using fluorescent spectrophotometry

The analysis code data_analysis_modelling.R uses the cleaned datasets, which is already deposited in the cleaned_datasets folder, but the raw data for which is included: if one wishes, they can make the cleaned dataset by themnsekves by using the other R scripts provided. To run the analysis and modelling only, the cleaned dataset 'competition_data_calibrated_shifted.csv' is used. Stan code and pre-compiled executibles are in the stan_models folder, though these too can be compiled by oneself if desired.
